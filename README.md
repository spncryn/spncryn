Hello, my name's Spencer, and I make games. 

I have a particular interest in narrative design. A lot of my work revolves around the interrogation of the relationship between player and authorial agency. Basically, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to design stories and mechanics that subvert and frustrate player expectations in (hopefully) interesting ways.
